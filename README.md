### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**TkZero**](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/TkZero), a wrapper for Tkinter!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Python**, **Java**, **TypeScript** (in [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/)), and embedded **C++** (in Arduino)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: UnsignedArduino@outlook.com or Ckyiu#9659 on Discord or [UnsignedArduino](https://forum.makecode.com/u/UnsignedArduino/summary) on the [MakeCode Forums](https://forum.makecode.com/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't think block coding is pathetic when the project has over 1k blocks. ðŸ˜‚
